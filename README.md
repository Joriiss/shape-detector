# Shape Recognition Project

This project trains a neural network to recognize shapes in images. It can tell if an image contains a circle, square, or triangle.

## What it does

The program looks at images of shapes and learns to identify them. After training, it can look at a new image and tell you what shape it is.

## How to use

### Step 1: Install the required libraries

First, you need to install the Python libraries that the code uses:

pip install tensorflow numpy scikit-learn pillowOr if you have a requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt### Step 2: Prepare your data

Make sure your images are organized in folders like this:
